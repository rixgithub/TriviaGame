# TriviaGame

### Overview

This is a trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 

* A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, the app shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it displays the next question without user input.

* If the player runs out of time, the game tells the player that time's up and it displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, it tells the player they selected the wrong option and then displays the correct answer. It then waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

* On the final screen, we show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game without reloading the page.
